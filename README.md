Application Overview
--------------------
Travel Journal is a MEAN full-stack web application allowing users to track their travels by entering date, city, and location. This application allows users to register for an account/login to an existing account and begin to keep track their travels. The application will utilize a Google Map API allowing travelers to mark their location while travel journaling. User can also upload a photo of their choosing along with some detail information about the journey.

Why create this app?

This app was created for any traveler that wants to log their whereabouts while on the road in order to ease the burden of long-hand journaling.
